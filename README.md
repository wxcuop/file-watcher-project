# File Watcher Project

This project monitors local directories (including mapped drives), filters files based on name patterns and XML content, imports CSV/XLSX files into a database, executes SQL scripts before and after import, uploads files to an S3 bucket, copies and archives files to local directories, deletes files by moving them to /dev/null, and sends notifications via Kafka when a file flow is complete.
